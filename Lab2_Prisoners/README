Need to know

1) std:: ios :: exceptions
2) factories (should find out about constructors )
3) working with files
4) STL

How to organize:

1)Basic class - strategy (interface)
2) Each strategy has its own file with parameters, history and so forth
3)Matrix of the game - is in the programm
4)Factory for all strategies
There is an obstract class for all strategies
All strategies have their own behavior so every class - is strategy
